PyJobShop and Temporal Networks
====

### stnu_fjsp.py
This script uses a PyJobShop example for the FJSP, and converts it's solution into a STNU and runs the DC-checking algorithm.

### stnu_rcpsp_max.py
This script uses the uses an instance from RCPSP/max and our code, but now uses a PyJobShop model to solve the deterministic problem and to construct the STNU.

### rcpsp_example_pyjobshop.py
This script has and example from the PyJobShop package on the rcpsp.

### utils.py
This script contains a piece of code from Joost Berkhout which is close to what we have developed for get_resource_chains. I also copied our get_resource_chains there, because I expect that we will make adjustments to it.
